# ASD-Classification-Model
This project applies machine learning to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) classification using a public dataset. Models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN were trained and evaluated. Their performance was compared to identify the most effective model for ASD prediction.
